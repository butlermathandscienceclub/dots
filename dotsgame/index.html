<h1>Game Description</h1>
<p>In Circles and Dots in a Box, two players compete to be the first one to get their goal circle to a certain size. Each player has a
circle (that is not hollow) that they move around and a goal circle, witch is hollow. When a player collides with a goal circle, even 
if it is the other player's, the circle grows bigger and the player goes to a random place on the screen. However, if you colide with a
green circle, your goal circle shrinks. Player 1's color is black, and player 2's color is red. Use keys to control players. And most 
all, have fun!</p>
